# OOP---Project-7--Database-Application

Elia Schwartz, COP 3330 - 33777, June 1, 2025.

Understand and get comfortable creating a database and accessing pieces of data.
Students were tasked with creating a University database with Engineering students' inputs using the SQLite system.
Executing queries to display, add, remove, and sort students in the database, in the program, and in the SQLite helper GUI, showing on the command line and/or console.

I used the video from a Valencia College Professor, Evans - Database Connectivity with SQLite and IntelliJ video as a template that was 
provided to me by my COP 3330C professor Leon Silas, as resource material.
I used and created my own data for all the entries in the EngineeringStudents table
